### Analysis scripts
To invoke the Clang Static Analyzer, it is recommended to use the [scan-build]
(https://github.com/rizsotto/scan-build) package implemented in Python. You can
either use the scripts being contained in LLVM trunk
(`llvm/tools/clang/tools/scan-build-py/bin`) or install the scripts with `pip
install scan-build`. Note that on `make install` LLVM copies old Perl versions
of the scripts to `/usr/local/bin` which therefore might overwrite versions
installed with pip. To run Clang-Tidy on a project, use the `run-clang-tidy.py`
script contained in `llvm/tools/clang/tools/extra/clang-tidy/tool`.

### Invoke analysis

Clang Static Analyzer:

- As the MPI wrapper compiler interferes with the `scan-build` script, it is
  recommended to invoke the analysis based on a [compilation database]
  (http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html), generated by
  `intercept-build (make|ninja|...)`. Note that databases generated by CMake can
  differ from those generated by `intercept-build`. If the
  `compile_commands.json` file denotes `mpicc|mpic++` as the used compiler, no
  reports are emitted.

- After the compilation database is created, analysis can be triggered with:<br>
  `analyze-build --enable-checker optin.mpi.MPI-Checker --use-analyzer
  /path/to/clang`

Clang-Tidy:

- Run `run-clang-tidy.py`:
```
llvm/tools/clang/tools/extra/clang-tidy/tool/run-clang-tidy.py \
    -p=path/compdb \
    -clang-tidy-binary=/path/to/clang-tidy \
    -checks='-*,mpi-type-mismatch,mpi-buffer-deref'
```
