### Analysis scripts
To invoke the Clang Static Analyzer, it is recommended to use the latest
[scan-build package](https://github.com/rizsotto/scan-build).  You can either
use the scripts being contained in LLVM trunk
(`llvm/tools/clang/tools/scan-build-py/bin`) or install the scripts with `pip
install scan-build`. Note that on `make install` LLVM copies old Perl versions
of the scripts to `/usr/local/bin` which therefore overwrite the recent pip
versions.

### Invoke analysis

- As the MPI wrapper compiler most often interferes with the `scan-build` script, it is
  recommended to invoke the analysis based on a [compilation database]
  (http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html), generated by
  `intercept-build`. Note that databases generated by CMake can differ from
  those generated by `intercept-build`, which is why a specific setup might be
  necessary ([see here](https://github.com/0ax1/MPI-Checker/tree/master/examples/cmake/basic)).

- After the compilation database is created, analysis can be triggered with:<br>
  `analyze-build --enable-checker optin.mpi.MPI-Checker --use-analyzer
  $clang_trunk_version`
